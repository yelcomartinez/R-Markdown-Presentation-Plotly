## Code

Through this code we try to plot the closing prices of major European stock indices in the years of 1991 to 1998.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
library(plotly)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
data("UsStockMarkets")
stocks <- as.data.frame(EuStockMarkets) %>%
  gather(index, price) %>%
  mutate(time = rep(time(EuStockMarkets), 4))
plot_ly(stocks, x = ~time, y = ~price, color = ~index, mode = "lines")
```
